# DigitalForge - Your TypeScript-Powered Development Accelerator

DigitalForge is a streamlined TypeScript project template designed to accelerate development workflows and promote code quality by providing a pre-configured environment with modern tools and best practices. It eliminates common setup hurdles, allowing developers to focus immediately on building features instead of wrestling with boilerplate and configuration. The core aim of DigitalForge is to offer a robust and adaptable foundation for a wide range of TypeScript-based applications, from simple CLI tools to complex server-side projects.

This repository offers a well-structured project skeleton including pre-configured linting rules with ESLint and Prettier, automated testing capabilities utilizing Jest, and a modular architecture that facilitates maintainability and scalability. By adopting DigitalForge, developers can enforce consistent code style across their projects, automate quality checks, and easily integrate new features and dependencies. Furthermore, the included example code serves as a practical demonstration of recommended TypeScript practices, offering a valuable learning resource for those new to the language or seeking to improve their proficiency.

DigitalForge is not merely a starting point; it's a commitment to efficiency and maintainability. It promotes a "batteries included" approach, bundling essential development tools within a clearly defined project structure. The careful selection of dependencies and configuration options reflects a focus on performance, security, and ease of use. Whether you're a seasoned TypeScript veteran or a developer just getting started, DigitalForge aims to simplify your workflow and empower you to build high-quality applications with confidence. The modular design encourages a mindset of separation of concerns which lends itself to easier testing and refactoring as the codebase grows.

**Key Features**

*   **Pre-configured ESLint and Prettier:** Enforces consistent code style and catches potential errors early in the development process. The configuration includes rules for TypeScript-specific code style and best practices, ensuring a uniform and high-quality codebase.
*   **Jest Testing Framework:** Provides a robust and reliable framework for unit and integration testing. Example tests are included to demonstrate how to write effective test cases and integrate them into your development workflow. Configuration files are set up to automatically run tests on file changes during development.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The project is structured into distinct modules, promoting separation of concerns and improving code maintainability. This architecture allows for easy addition of new features and modules without disrupting existing functionality. The example module demonstrates a clear structure for code organization.
*   **TypeScript Configuration:** Includes a carefully curated `tsconfig.json` file with optimal settings for TypeScript compilation and code generation. This configuration maximizes code performance and adheres to industry best practices for TypeScript development.
*   **Example Code:** Provides a practical demonstration of recommended TypeScript practices, including module organization, interface definitions, and error handling. The example code showcases best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable TypeScript code.
*   **Development Server (Optional):** Integrates a simple development server that automatically reloads the application on code changes, streamlining the development process. (Note: This is an optional feature and may require additional configuration based on project needs).
*   **Continuous Integration (CI) Ready:** Includes configuration files for popular CI/CD platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing and linting on every commit. This ensures that all code changes adhere to the project's standards and that any errors are caught early.

**Technology Stack**

*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code reliability and maintainability. TypeScript provides enhanced tooling and supports modern JavaScript features.
*   **ESLint:** A static code analysis tool used to identify and fix potential errors and enforce coding style guidelines. ESLint helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
*   **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter that automatically formats code according to predefined rules. Prettier ensures a consistent code style throughout the project.
*   **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework used for writing unit and integration tests. Jest provides a simple and powerful API for testing JavaScript and TypeScript code.
*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. DigitalForge relies on Node.js for running build tools, tests, and the development server.

**Installation**

1.  Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/DigitalForge.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    cd DigitalForge
3.  Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

    npm install
    // OR
    yarn install
4.  Configure your environment variables (see Configuration section below).

**Configuration**

The project relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables, modifying their values as needed:



*   `NODE_ENV`: Specifies the environment (development, production, test).
*   `PORT`: Specifies the port on which the server will listen.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the verbosity of the logs (e.g., debug, info, warn, error).

**Usage**

To run the development server (if applicable and configured):

npm run dev
// OR
yarn dev

To run the tests:

npm test
// OR
yarn test

To lint the code:

npm run lint
// OR
yarn lint

To format the code:

npm run format
// OR
yarn format

Refer to the `package.json` file for a complete list of available scripts. The example code within the `src` directory will provide more in-depth examples. API documentation will be generated and accessible via a dedicated route if further API routes are implemented.
