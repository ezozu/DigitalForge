# DigitalForge: Decentralized NFT Marketplace Framework

A robust and modular framework for building decentralized NFT marketplaces with on-chain metadata aggregation and gas-optimized fractionalization.

DigitalForge provides a comprehensive solution for launching and managing NFT marketplaces with advanced features designed to enhance liquidity and user experience. This framework leverages the power of on-chain data aggregation to provide rich metadata directly accessible within the smart contracts, eliminating the need for centralized off-chain metadata storage and retrieval. Furthermore, DigitalForge incorporates gas-optimized fractionalization smart contracts allowing for the creation of ERC-20 tokens representing ownership shares in individual NFTs, opening up new avenues for trading and investment.

This framework is specifically designed for developers looking to create scalable and efficient NFT marketplaces with advanced capabilities. It offers a flexible architecture that can be customized to meet the specific needs of different use cases, from art marketplaces to gaming asset exchanges. DigitalForge promotes transparency and trust by relying on verifiable on-chain data and minimizing reliance on centralized components. This approach ensures that the marketplace operates autonomously and resists censorship or manipulation.

The core of DigitalForge lies in its smart contract suite, written in Solidity and rigorously tested for security and gas efficiency. These contracts handle NFT listing, bidding, sales, and fractionalization, all while minimizing gas costs through carefully optimized code. The framework also includes a TypeScript-based SDK that provides a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the smart contracts, making it easy for developers to build custom frontends and integrations. DigitalForge empowers developers to create truly decentralized and innovative NFT marketplaces.

## Key Features

*   **On-Chain Metadata Aggregation:** Utilizes a decentralized indexing system to aggregate and store NFT metadata directly on-chain, eliminating reliance on centralized APIs and ensuring data integrity. This system employs a configurable aggregation strategy, allowing developers to select the most efficient method for their specific NFT collection (e.g., Merkle proof verification for large collections). The smart contracts provide functions to query this on-chain metadata, allowing for dynamic display and filtering of NFTs based on their attributes.

*   **Gas-Optimized Fractionalization:** Implements a suite of ERC-20 compliant fractionalization smart contracts that allow users to divide ownership of NFTs into smaller, tradeable units. The fractionalization process is designed to minimize gas costs through the use of optimized data structures and efficient algorithms. The contracts also support governance features, allowing fractional owners to vote on decisions related to the underlying NFT.

*   **Decentralized Order Book:** Features a fully decentralized order book implemented directly on the blockchain. This order book allows users to place bids and asks for NFTs, creating a transparent and efficient market for trading. The order book utilizes a matching engine that automatically executes trades when compatible orders are found.

*   **Royalty Enforcement:** Automatically enforces royalty payments to NFT creators on every sale. The smart contracts track the original creator of the NFT and automatically transfer the appropriate royalty amount to their address upon a successful transaction. This ensures that creators are fairly compensated for their work.

*   **TypeScript SDK:** Provides a comprehensive TypeScript SDK that simplifies interaction with the smart contracts. The SDK includes functions for listing NFTs, placing bids, executing trades, managing fractionalized ownership, and querying on-chain metadata. This SDK facilitates rapid development and integration with existing web3 applications.

*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily customize and extend the framework to meet their specific needs. The smart contracts are designed to be composable, and the TypeScript SDK provides a flexible API for interacting with the different components.

## Technology Stack

*   **Solidity:** Used for writing the smart contracts that govern the NFT marketplace logic. Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably Ethereum.
*   **TypeScript:** Used for developing the SDK and frontend components. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications.
*   **Hardhat:** Used for smart contract development, testing, and deployment. Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software, providing tools for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts.
*   **Ethers.js/Web3.js:** Used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. These are JavaScript libraries that allow developers to connect to Ethereum nodes and interact with smart contracts.
*   **Node.js:** Used for running the development environment and deploying the smart contracts. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/DigitalForge.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd DigitalForge
3.  Install dependencies:
    npm install
4.  Install Hardhat globally (if not already installed):
    npm install -g hardhat
5.  Compile the smart contracts:
    npx hardhat compile

## Configuration

The project requires several environment variables to be configured. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Ethereum private key for deploying and interacting with the smart contracts.
*   `INFURA_API_KEY`: Your Infura API key for connecting to the Ethereum network.
*   `NETWORK`: The Ethereum network to deploy to (e.g., `mainnet`, `rinkeby`, `goerli`).

Example `.env` file:

PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY
NETWORK=goerli

## Usage

To deploy the smart contracts to a specific network, run the following command:

npx hardhat deploy --network [NETWORK]

Replace `[NETWORK]` with the name of the network you want to deploy to (e.g., `goerli`).

To interact with the smart contracts using the TypeScript SDK, import the necessary modules and functions from the SDK.

Example:

import { DigitalForgeSDK } from './sdk';

const sdk = new DigitalForgeSDK(provider, signer, contractAddresses);

// List an NFT for sale
sdk.listNFT(nftAddress, tokenId, price).then((tx) => {
  console.log('Transaction hash:', tx.hash);
});

Detailed API documentation for the SDK is available in the `docs` directory.
